\arguments{
\item{cohort}{A cohort; see \code{\link{generate_cohort}}}

\item{method}{Method used to construct the table; either
\code{time-point}, \code{drug-era} and \code{patient}.

\code{time-point})}

\description{
Creates the \eqn{2 \times 2} contingency tables for \emph{all}
drug-ADR pairs in a specific cohort. The function is basically
a wrapper for \code{\link{create2x2table}}
}
\details{
\cr\cr
A table is structured in the following form:
\tabular{lcc}{
\tab ADR \tab not ADR\cr
drug \tab \code{a} \tab \code{c}\cr
not drug \tab \code{b} \tab \code{d}
}
}
\section{Ways to construct the table}{
The counts can be constructed in three different ways. See for
two of them Zorych et al. (2013).
\subsection{By individual time-points (\code{time-point})}{

Each time-point is counted separately. The counts are the
\emph{number of time points} that
\itemize{
\item{\code{a} - the drug was prescribed and the ADR occurred}
\item{\code{b} - the drug was not prescribed but the ADR occurred}
\item{\code{c} - the drug was prescribed but the ADR did not occur}
\item{\code{d} - the drug was not prescribed and the ADR did not occur}
}
Note that in this case the total count \code{n = a + b + c + d} is
the same as the total number of time points observed, i.e., the total
number of patients times the number of time points observed:
\code{n_patients * simulation_time}.
}

\subsection{By individual patients (\code{patient})}{

In this case, individual patients are counted. The counts are the \emph{number
of patients} that
\itemize{
\item{\code{a} - were prescribed the drug and did experience the ADR }
\item{\code{b} - were never prescribed the drug and did experience the ADR}
\item{\code{c} - were prescribed the drug and never experienced the ADR}
\item{\code{d} - were never prescribed the drug and never experienced the ADR}
}
In this case, the total count \code{n = a + b + c +d} is the same as
the number of patients, \code{n_patients}.
}

\subsection{By individual patients (\code{drug-era})}{

In this case we look at \emph{drug-eras}, i.e., periods in which the
patients was prescribed or not prescribed the drug for a longer time.
For example, if the patient was prescribed the drug from time point 3 to
6, then that period is called a drug-era.
The counts are the \emph{number of drug- and non-drug eras} in which
\itemize{
\item{\code{a} - the drug was prescribed and the ADR occurred}
\item{\code{b} - the drug was not prescribed but the ADR occurred}
\item{\code{c} - the drug was prescribed but the ADR did not occur}
\item{\code{d} - the drug was not prescribed and the ADR did not occur}
}
In this case, the total count \code{n} is the total number of drug- and
non-drug eras.
}
}

\examples{
set.seed(1)
cohort <- generate_cohort(n_patients = 200) 

# create the 2x2 contingency table per time-point, 
# drug-era and patient: 
create2x2table(cohort, method = "time-point")
create2x2table(cohort, method = "drug-era")
create2x2table(cohort, method = "patient")
