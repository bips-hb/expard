#' Creating a \eqn{2 \times 2} Table
#' 
#' Creates a \eqn{2 \times 2} contingency table for a 
#' drug and ADR. \cr\cr
#' A table is structured in the following form:  
#' \tabular{lcc}{
#'    \tab ADR \tab not ADR\cr
#'   drug \tab \code{a} \tab \code{c}\cr
#'   not drug \tab \code{b} \tab \code{d}
#' }
#' 
#' # Ways to construct the table 
#' The counts can be constructed in three different ways. See for 
#' two of them Zorych et al. (2013).  
#' 
#' ## By individual time-points (\code{time-point}) 
#' Each time-point is counted separately. The counts are the 
#' \emph{number of time points} that
#' \itemize{ 
#'    \item{\code{a} - the drug was prescribed and the ADR occurred}
#'    \item{\code{b} - the drug was not prescribed but the ADR occurred}
#'    \item{\code{c} - the drug was prescribed but the ADR did not occur}
#'    \item{\code{d} - the drug was not prescribed and the ADR did not occur}
#' }
#' Note that in this case the total count \code{n = a + b + c + d} is 
#' the same as the total number of time points observed, i.e., the total 
#' number of patients times the number of time points observed: 
#' \code{n_patients * simulation_time}. 
#' 
#' ## By individual patients (\code{patient})
#' In this case, individual patients are counted. The counts are the \emph{number 
#' of patients} that 
#' \itemize{
#'    \item{\code{a} - were prescribed the drug and did experience the ADR }
#'    \item{\code{b} - were never prescribed the drug and did experience the ADR}
#'    \item{\code{c} - were prescribed the drug and never experienced the ADR}
#'    \item{\code{d} - were never prescribed the drug and never experienced the ADR}
#' }
#' In this case, the total count \code{n = a + b + c +d} is the same as 
#' the number of patients, \code{n_patients}.
#' 
#' ## By individual patients (\code{drug-era})
#' In this case we look at \emph{drug-eras}, i.e., periods in which the 
#' patients was prescribed or not prescribed the drug for a longer time. 
#' For example, if the patient was prescribed the drug from time point 3 to 
#' 6, then that period is called a drug-era. 
#' The counts are the \emph{number of drug- and non-drug eras} in which 
#' \itemize{ 
#'    \item{\code{a} - the drug was prescribed and the ADR occurred}
#'    \item{\code{b} - the drug was not prescribed but the ADR occurred}
#'    \item{\code{c} - the drug was prescribed but the ADR did not occur}
#'    \item{\code{d} - the drug was not prescribed and the ADR did not occur}
#' }
#' In this case, the total count \code{n} is the total number of drug- and 
#' non-drug eras.

#' @param drug_ADR_pair A drug-ADR pair; see \code{\link{generate_cohort}} 
#' @param method Method used to construct the table; either 
#'               \code{time-point}, \code{drug-era} and \code{patient}. 
#'               See the description for more information (Default: 
#'               \code{time-point})
#'
#' @return A \code{cont_table} object; a list with  
#'     \item{\code{a},\code{b},\code{c},\code{d}}{The counts in the table}
#'     \item{\code{method}}{Method that was used to construct the table}
#'     \item{\code{n}}{Total count (\code{n = a + b + c + d}). The interpretation 
#'                depends on the \code{method} used}
